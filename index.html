		            <p class="desc">I spent the first few years of my life in Bangkok with my parents before moving to Jakarta when I was 4, and eventually Singapore, when I was 12. Having lived in 3 different countries has exposed me to different cultures, ways of life, and ideologies. Being well-traveled coupled with living abroad most of my childhood has given me a global perspective on many things and I try to take away and practice good habits I see in different cultures. Being able to speak fluent Bahasa Indonesia allowed me to interact on a deeper level with the locals there and learn even more from them.

	            	<h3>Strong Leadership Qualities</h3>  

		            <p class="desc">Having been selected to be an officer in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) was an honour and a privilege for me. Pushing myself through the mentally and physically rigorous 9-Month Officer Cadet Course shaped me into more mature, responsible adult. After commissioning, I led a team of 24 Men in the Special Rescue Unit through dangerous and even life-threatening operations. My time with the SCDF has taught me how to work with and lead various kinds of people.

	            	<h3>Working Under Pressure</h3>

		            <p class="desc">My time with the Civil Defence Force and Army has taught me how to make well-informed decisions both rationally and calmly. In cases of fires, you have only a split second to make decision which could mean the difference between life and death. Having to lead a platoon through daunting exercises has honed my ability to work under pressure and know which risks to take when. Many hobbies I have such as Scuba Diving and Motorcycling also require me to stay focused and alert at all times.

		            <p class="desc">While focusing on my work in school, I also give a lot of importance to my extra-curricular activities. I chose to stay on Campus for my first two years of University in Sheares Hall and have been actively involved in both hall and school activities. I joined a total of 8 extra-curricular activities in hall and 3 more in school during my first two years of University. Scroll down to find out more about my University Life.

This has put me at an advantage in school and am sure will continue to help me in my future workplace. Being eloquent has made me more of an extrovert, especially since I have a vibrant campus life. I have met and interacted with so many different people and have been presented with many opportunities because of these them.</p>

My ability to adapt to challenging situations and excel in differing environments helped me numerous times; such as the physically demanding 9-month long Officer Cadet Course with the Civil Defence Force where I had to adhere to strict disciplinary, academic, and physical standards.

					      <h4>Projects</h4>		      
					      <li>I am currently working with my Professor, mentor and 4 group mates to build the world's first ultralight and electric Autogyro. My team and I have been applying engineering concepts and ideas taught in school, to our project. Such as understanding the weight distribution of the autogyro and stress dstribution throughout the plane using both manual calculations and autoCAD software. We have also used concepts leared in our Fluid Mechanics class to help streamline our plane and improve efficiency. The aesthetics and ergonomics of the plane have also been designed using principles taught in Design thinking class. We aim to get the machine flying by August 2017. Click on the link to see our project poster. I will upload a video upon completion of the project.</li>
					      <li>I have done numerous engineering projects in university but one of my favorites would be a truss bridge design project where we designed a truss bridge based on truss analysis calculations.</li>
					      <li>I built some simple Arduino projects such as a environmental stations during my free time. I will dedicate more time to Arduino during the holiday where I plan to build a mini car and a truss bridge with Arduino-controlled lighting.</li>

					      <p>I was and still am in the Indian Cultural Society in University, here we engaged in many community involvement programmes to help the less fortunate such as welfare pack distributions and tutoring needy students.</p>
					      <p>I embarked on a 3 week long overseas community service project in Chiang Mai (Thailand) in the summer of 2016. There we rebuilt a community centre and taugh local schoolchildren english, math and science in an interactive manner to encourage learning.</p>

					      <h4>Travel</h4>		      
					      <p>As cliché as it is for people to “show-off” to others about travelling the world, I decided to do it anyway as Travelling has taught me a plethora of lessons I would have never been able to get in school or even at home.</p>			               
					      <p>My first official backpacking trip was to Japan in 2013; I went with a friend and had the best travel experience of my life. I had “couch surfed” and stayed with Japanese hosts whenever possible throughout my trips. Couch surfing has introduced me to so many nice people all around the world. I have since taken more backpacking trips to India, Thailand and Vietnam.</p> 
					      <p>Another major Backpacking trip I had was in Europe. I travelled to 7 different countries and couch surfed in Italy, Paris, Belgium and the UK. Living with a local when you are overseas truly broadens your horizons, through my interactions with my hosts I learned about topics such as Belgian Politics, French Geography and the Italian Economy, all things I would have not bothered to find out about my own. The last part of my trip was in the UK; for two weeks, I worked on a donkey farm in Bideford in exchange for food and accommodation. I had made this arrangement through a website “workaway.info”. </p>
